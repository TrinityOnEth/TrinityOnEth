Welcome to Trinity, an ERC token project dedicated to creating a suite of bots and other accessible tools designed to streamline and enhance user experiences. Our goal is to provide a range of features that promote ease of access and convenience across various platforms.

At the heart of Trinity is our flagship offering, Trinity’s Bot, a versatile solution catering to diverse user needs. Whether you’re seeking real-time updates or engaging promotional content, our bot has you covered.

Our commitment to accessibility extends beyond our own projects. Trinity’s Bot is designed to be a public bot, enabling its utilization in any project. By providing this resource to the wider community, we foster collaboration and empower developers and enthusiasts alike.

Join us on our journey as we revolutionize the way users engage with bots and tools, and experience the convenience and empowerment that Trinity brings to the forefront.

Trinity’s Bot!
The bot for everyone’s Ease of Access

Features:
- Tweet Archive: Get the most recent tweets by using the command /tweets.
- Shill Templates: Receive random shill templates by using the command /shill.
- Burned Amount: Check the current amount burned using the command /burned.
- Get a custom Trinity Profile picture with your name on it using the /custompfp command.
- Custom welcoming, which will put the user’s name into the welcoming gif.

This will all be made into a public bot so it can be used in any project! (Most already are)
